Contains both UI and API test cases.

For UI, I have used Java-Selenium

For API, since I have already created a Java Framework with multiple Page Objects, I used Java Rest Assured Library to help with the API automation

You can clone the AutomationTestProject and execute the UI test cases directly from the IDE or via terminal using mvn commands.

In the DriverWrapperClass, there are methods to capture screenshot in case of test failure. Modify path according to your folder.
